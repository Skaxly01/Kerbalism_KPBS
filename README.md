# Kerbalism_KPBS
Patch files to better use Kerbalism and the realism profile.

0 - Realism.cfg_BAK - *** A backup with minor changes to keep the mighty SN from having to update again. Works with Kerbalism 1.1.3. Changes waste ratio for food and properly adds the newer small oxygen tank.

1 - Patch file for KPBS. So close to calling it 1.0 I can smell it. Assume it's good enough for a career game?

2 - Realism Extra Parts - Just download the zip.

    Large Inline Water Tank - Water tank for 21 days for a crew of 3.
  
    Small Supply Container Plus - Food and filter material for 21 days for a crew of 3.
  
    Small Filtration Tank - 16 days filtration material per kerbal. Non-Tweakable.
    
These parts were derived from the TAC Life Support mod. All credit belongs to them. Models, texture files, and modified configs maintain TACLS identification. Support for Connected Living Space added.
