# Kerbalism_KPBS
Patch files to better use Kerbalism and the realism profile.


1 - Patch file for KPBS. So close to calling it 1.0 I can smell it. Assume it's good enough for a career game?

2 - Realism Extra Parts - Just download the zip.

    Large Inline Water Tank - Water tank for 21 days for a crew of 3.
  
    Small Supply Container Plus - Food and filter material for 21 days for a crew of 3.
  
    Small Filtration Tank - 16 days filtration material per kerbal. Non-Tweakable.
    
These parts were derived from the TAC Life Support mod. All credit belongs to them. Models, texture files, and modified configs maintain TACLS identification. Support for Connected Living Space added.
